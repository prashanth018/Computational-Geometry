Time Complexity:

DCEL:
- All the methods except addEdge() takes O(1).
- So Whenever addEdge() is used it takes O(|E|) in the worst case.

Monotonizing a Concave Polygon (in main() function):
- initializeFace, initializeEdge, initializeVert each of them takes at max O(|E|)
- maximum number of split and merge vertices possible is less than n/2 where n is the number of vertices
- for every split vertex and merge vertex in the worst case we should be joining them with a regular vertex in this case we get to insert n/2 diagonals.
- if we insert n/2 diagonals where n is number of vertices, we will have O(|V|*|E|) for the whole operation because it takes O(|E|) in the worst case to insert a diagonal

MonotoneTriangulation:
- TimeComplexity of these is equivalent to number of diagonals to be inserted.
- it takes n-2 diagonals to be inserted in any polygon, where n is the number of vertices. Retrieving each of these vertices takes O(log(|V|)) for each vertex.
- each diagonal insertion takes O(|E|) in worst case.
- Overall it takes O(|E|*|V|*log(|V|)).

Hence the Overall Time Complexity is O(|E|*|V|*log(|V|)).


Space Complexity:

DCEL:
- vertrec -> O(|V|)
- edgerec -> O(|E|)
- facerec -> O(|E|/3)

MonotoneTriangulation:
- To keep track of the vertices in the left chain and the right chain i used a map stl in c++ which is an RB tree. It takes O(log(|V|)) time for insertion and retrieval  
- We used a priority queue which takes O(|V|).


Monotonizing a Concave Polygon (in main() function):
- As already said, initializeFace, initializeEdge, initializeVert each of these take O(|E|/3), O(|E|), O(|V|) respectively.
- Since we can at max add n/2 diagonals, content in edgerec and facerec can at max double which is still linear.
- In order to maintain T which is status queue we can in the worst case have |E| leaves, which means 2*|E| number of total nodes which is still linear.
- Hence in this step the space complexity is O(|E|).

Hence the Overall space complexity is O(|E|). 


Degeneracy:

- When there is an input which has almost same X coordinate, it failed.(Ran into infinite loop).
- It fails when split vertex and merge vertex are very near.
